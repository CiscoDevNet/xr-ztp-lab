    "# Automate IOS-XR Zero Touch Provisioning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "On-boarding devices with the initial configuration (day-0 configuration) is a task which needs to be automated in many use-cases, especially if a large number of devices are involved. By limiting the human interaction in this process as much as possible service providers can reduce “truck-offload to service-activation” time, avoid to send skilled personal to the field to configure devices manually and achieve better deployment predictability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the management of day-1...day-n configurations we usually use the Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO), so in the majority of use-cases the main goal of the day-0 configuration would be to bootstrap the devices and provide them with the minimal configuration needed to be able to onboard them in Cisco NSO - this means basically setting an IP address, user, password, generate some keys. Of course, we are able to manage more complex configurations if the use-case demands it, but it is recommended to manage as much as possible from the configuration using Cisco NSO, if available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the NED supports sending CLI commands to the device (using the life-status actions) it is also possible and straightforward to implement the MOPs (using workflows or scripts) which will use NSO to perform a software upgrade on the device to the desired version.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main protocols supported by Cisco products for automating the day-0 configuration provisioning, depending on the type of device:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tCisco ZTP (Zero Touch Provisioning) - available on IOS-XR devices\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tCisco PnP (Plug and Play) - available on branch devices (IOS/IOS-XE devices)\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPOAP (PowerOn Auto Provisioning) - available on the Nexus switches\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates the use of Zero Touch Provisioning Automation in the context of Cisco IOS-XR. There is also a brief description of the other protocols at the end of the lab guide as well as an example of using the PNP protocol with the NSO PNP server for an IOS-XE router.\n"

    "## Cisco ZTP\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/ztp_1.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "On IOS-XR, ZTP process starts at boot time and scans the configuration for the presence of a username. \n",
    "If there is no username configured, ZTP starts a DHCP client on the management interface for IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously, and wait for a response. Together with the IP address the DHCP server will provide an URL to download a config file or a script using option 67 (or 59 for IPv6). We are using http URLs but other protocols like TFTP are also supported. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ZTP process will download the file and based on the first line of the text file received will: \n",
    "•\tapply the configuration commands it contains (if it starts with ”!! IOS XR”)\n",
    "•\tassume this is a shell script and start the execution  (if it starts with ”#!/bin/bash” or ”#!/bin/sh”) \n",
    "•\tstart the execution if it is python script\n",
    "\n",
    "If the text file cannot be interpreted as a script or a configuration file, or is bigger than 100MB, ZTP will erase the file and terminate its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the different DHCP options/functions available on the server it is possible to dynamically create the file URL based on specific device information like the serial number. In this way we will be able to identify the device which made the request on the server side and provide a customized day0 configuration/script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a script is the most flexible solution since inside the script it is possible to download other config files and apply them (using curl or wget for example / python libraries), implement logic, install packages and so on. In order to notify the provisioning server that the device has finished applying its configuration usually we make a HTTP request as the last command in the script which will signalize to our server that the device finished applying the config.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The description in this section relates to Classic ZTP process\n",
    "> supported on IOS-XR. In addition, IOS-XR Release 7 introduces a\n",
    "> enhanced process called Secure ZTP (defined by Yang-Models to\n",
    "> implement interactions between the router and a RESTCONF based ZTP\n",
    "> Server) as well as support for YANG XML payload in the ZTP files,\n",
    "> these enhancements are out of the scope of the current lab."

The server will check if there are some tasks still to be performed on the client (like sending a config file) and responds accordingly. If the device is not in the server mapping database, or if there are no additional tasks to be performed it sends a \"back-off\" response which basically instructs the device to wait the server defined back-off timeout before sending a new work request. \n",

In order to acquire the IP address of the PnP server, the PnP agent goes through one of the following discovery mechanisms:\n",

    "On NXOS, very similar with ZTP, the POAP (PowerOn Auto Provisioning) relies on different DHCP options(66 and 67) for obtaining the URL of the configuration script. The process starts at the boot time and checks if a start-up config exits. If there is no start-up configuration on the switch, POAP starts a DHCP client on the management interface (on version 7.0(3)I5(1)) or all interfaces (starting with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I5(2) and Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I6(1)) for an IP address and wait for a response. Together with the IP address the DHCP server will provide an HTTP/HTTPS/TFTP URL to download a PYTHON script using option 66 and 67. The POAP process will download the file, check the checksum of the file and if it is correct starts the execution of the script. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/poap_1.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    " \n",
    "The script file must contain the checksum of the file itself on the top of the file. That means that in contrast with ZTP, whenever the script file is modified the checksum needs to be re-calculated and added to the file.\n",
    "Configuration of the DHCP server (ISC-DHCP) to be able to provide both the server and the filename for download for the POAP protocol needs to contain 2 options:\n",
    "\n",
