Using a netconf client (ncclient for python, anc/jnc for java, etc) we can connect to NSO over NETCONF and listen indefinitely to incoming updates for a stream that tracks the configuration retrieval and onboarding steps of ZTP. On reception of a notification, the application makes a REST call that will result in posting the notification in a Webex Teams chat-room on behalf of a chat-bot.\n",
